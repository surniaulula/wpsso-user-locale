Quick and easy locale / language / region selector for the WordPress admin toolbar.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**Provides a convenient locale / language / region selector in the WordPress admin toolbar.**

**Perfect for anyone that needs to switch languages quickly and easily:**

Allows logged-in users to easily change their preferred locale / language / region setting right from the toolbar menu, instead of having to modify their user profile settings.

<!-- /about -->

The default behavior of WordPress is to apply the user locale preference to the admin back-end only - the WPSSO User Locale Selector add-on can optionally extend the locale preference to the front-end webpage as well.

<h3>Do you use the Polylang plugin?</h3>

If the Polylang plugin is detected, the locale selector will automatically use the correct Polylang language URLs.

<h3>WPSSO Core Required</h3>

WPSSO User Locale Selector (WPSSO UL) is an add-on for the [WPSSO Core plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/), which creates extensive and complete structured data to present your content at its best for social sites and search results â€“ no matter how URLs are shared, reshared, messaged, posted, embedded, or crawled.
